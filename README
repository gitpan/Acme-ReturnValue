NAME
    Acme::ReturnValue - report interesting module return values

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::ReturnValue;
        my $rvs = Acme::ReturnValue->new;
        $rvs->in_INC;
        foreach (@{$rvs->interesting}) {
            say $_->{package} . ' returns ' . $_->{value}; 
        }

DESCRIPTION
    "Acme::ReturnValue" will list 'interesting' return values of modules.
    'Interesting' means something other than '1'.

  METHODS
   run
    run from the commandline (via acme_returnvalue.pl

   waste_some_cycles
        my $data = $arv->waste_some_cycles( '/some/module.pm' );

    "waste_some_cycles" parses the passed in file using PPI. It tries to get
    the last statement and extract it's value.

    "waste_some_cycles" returns a hash with following keys

    *   file

        The file

    *   package

        The package defintion (the first one encountered in the file

    *   value

        The return value of that file

    "waste_some_cycles" will also put this data structure into interesting
    or boring.

    You might want to pack calls to "waste_some_cycles" into an "eval"
    because PPI dies on parse errors.

   _is_code
    Stolen directly from Perl::Critic::Policy::Modules::RequireEndWithOne as
    suggested by Chris Dolan.

    Thanks!

   in_CPAN
   in_INC
        $arv->in_INC;

    Collect return values from all *.pm files in @INC.

   in_dir
        $arv->in_dir( $some_dir );

    Collect return values from all *.pm files in $dir.

   in_file
        $arv->in_file( $some_file );

    Collect return value from the passed in file.

    If waste_some_cycles failed, puts information on the failing file into
    failed.

   interesting
    Returns an ARRAYREF containing 'interesting' modules.

   boring
    Returns an ARRAYREF containing 'boring' modules.

   failed
    Returns an ARRAYREF containing unparsable modules.

BUGS
    Probably many, because I'm not sure I master PPI yet.
